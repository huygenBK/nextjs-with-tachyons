# [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) + [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io)

This loads Tachyons from source so you can customize variables before it gets compiled.

I have no idea whether this scales nor performs. But it works.

Credit goes to the [bundled styled-jsx-postcss example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/v3-beta/examples/with-styled-jsx-postcss) for most of the code.
